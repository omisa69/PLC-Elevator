# PLC-Elevator
I developed a PLC program using Ladder Diagram (LD) to control a three-floor virtual elevator, following structured programming principles. The project involved implementing logic for floor selection buttons, elevator movement, and door control using function blocks such as timers, counters, and triggers. The program was designed to handle realistic elevator behavior, ensuring that button presses while the elevator was moving were not queued and that unnecessary global variables were avoided. Debugging and verification were conducted using TwinCATâ€™s simulation environment, and the program was later converted to Function Block Diagram (FBD) to compare programming styles. The project emphasized clean code structure, logical rung splitting, and adherence to programming best practices for readability and maintainability.
